# IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis

This project is a simple implementation of sentiment analysis on the popular IMDb movie review dataset. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. It also includes wordclouds of positive and negative reviews to visualize the common words in each category.

The dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative. The model is trained on the training set and tested on the testing set to evaluate its accuracy.
